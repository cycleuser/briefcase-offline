Flatpak apps no longer request D-Bus session access by default. Most apps have no need to access the D-Bus session, unless they're a development tool that is inspecting D-Bus messages at runtime. If you experience errors related to this change, it is likely caused by an inconsistency between the ``bundle`` definition in your app configuration, and the way the app describes its bundle ID at runtime. If you *do* require D-Bus access, adding ``finish_arg."socket=session-bus" = true`` to the Flatpak configuration for your app will restore D-Bus session access.
